# General Overview
The aim of this project was to create a machine learning model on Microsoft Azure Ml then consume it through an endpoint. 
The dataset contains information about clients.

# Authentification
After installing az and login has succeeded

# Automated ML Experiment
I then created an automl experiment using the Bank Market Dataset, to perform classification.
Here is a screenshot of the uploaded dataset.

# Deploy the Model
After selecting the best model from the Automated ML, it was deployed using the Azure Container Instance. Deploying the best model will allow it to interact with the HTTP API server and interact with the model by sending data over POST requests.

The model was deployed, application insights were enabled and the logs were also retrieved. The screenshots are as follows:

# Swagger Documentation
The deployed model was consumed using swagger. This is done by copying the model's swagger JSON file is copied and used in accessing the documentation. Here are the  screenshots:

# Consume Model Endpoints
I updated the scoring_uri and the keys in the endpoints.py script. I used the ones generated by azure ml studio after deployment. This is important as it enables interaction with the model. Screenshots here:

# Create and Publish a Pipeline
At tis stage, I created, published and consumed a pipeline. Screenshots from the creation of the pipeline are:

# Future Improvement Suggestions
I think the model would be better if data preprocessing was done. I also noted that there was a class imbalance, yet no balancing techniques such as SMOTE were done.
